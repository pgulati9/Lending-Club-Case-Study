# Lending Club Case Study
There is a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers.The objective of this case study is to help the consumer finance company understand the consumer and loan attributes that influence the tendency of default by using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. 

The Lending company wants to analyse the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment and hence mitigate the credit risk.

## General Information
The objective of this case study is to help a consumer finance company understand the consumer and loan attributes that influence the tendency of default by using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.
The Lending company wants to analyse the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. 

Risks associated with lending company decision is twofold:
1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

 The company can utilise the knowledge on default risk drivers for its portfolio and risk assessment and hence mitigate the credit risk. 

## Conclusions
1. **Housing Status and Default Risk**: Rented and Mortgaged houses are more likely to default. This fact needs to be taken into account when underwriting the loans and careful credit analysis and pricing should be done when extending such loans.   
2. **Verification Status and Default Risk**: Non-verified incomes are more likely to default. The lending company can invest more effort and resources in verifying the incomes effectively before extending the loans.
3. **Debt Consolidation Loan Default Risk**: Debt consolidation loans are risky loans and more susceptible to default. The lending company should be cautious when approving loans for debt consolidation purpose and consider high pricing for the riskier loans.
4. **Geography and Default Risk**:Loan applicants in California, Florida and New York are more likely to default. The lending company can implement stricter credit policies and adjust the pricing based on loan riskiness.
5. **Loan Term and Default Risk**: Short term loans (term of 36 months) are more likely to default. The lending company should carefully evaluate the loans with shorter terms.
6. **Grade and Default Risk**: Loans with B and C grades are seen to have more defaults. The lending company should re-evaluate their grading system or underlying models and provide worse grades to the loans that are more likely to default.
7. **Experience and Default Risk**:Applicants with 10 + years of experience are more likely to default. Although, the total number of employees with 10+ years of experience is significantly higher than in other categories.But still, additional parameters should be considered when evaluating the credit-worthiness of a loan applicant.
8. **Seasonal Trends and Default Risk**:There are more loan applications in December and Q4.Loans issued in this period are also seen to have higher defaults. Lending company should exercise rigorous credit worthiness analysis in this high peak season by developing their infrastructure and resource management.
9. **Lending Amount and Default Risk**: Applicants with loan amount requests and funding of 5K-10K are more likely to default. The lending company should carefully analyse the loan applications with intermediate loan amount requests.
10. **DTI and Default Risk**: High Debt to Income Ratio applicants are more likely to default. The lending company should incorporate this information when underwriting the loans and should appropriately price the loans for higher riskiness.
11. **Income and Default Risk**: Income Bracket of 30K-60K are more likely to default. The lending company should carefully evaluate the credit worthiness of low-moderate income brackets for their repaying capacity when extending the loan.
12. **Credit History and Default Risk**:Applicants with less credit history ( less open credit lines, total credit lines, revolving balance or low utilisation rates) are more likely to default. The lending company critically evaluate the loan applications with less or no credit history.
