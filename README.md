# Lending Club Case Study
There is a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers.The objective of this case study is to help a consumer finance company understand the consumer and loan attributes that influence the tendency of default by using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. 
The Lending company wants to analyse the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment and hence mitigate the credit risk.

## General Information
The objective of this case study is to help a consumer finance company understand the consumer and loan attributes that influence the tendency of default by using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.
The Lending company wants to analyse the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. 

Risks associated with lending company decision is twofold:
1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

 The company can utilise the knowledge on default risk drivers for its portfolio and risk assessment and hence mitigate the credit risk. 

## Conclusions
1.Housing Status and Default Risk: Rented Households had the highest number of charge-off cases. The lending company should evaluate the loan applicants carefully before lending to rented households as they are more susceptible to default.
2. Verfication Status: whose income source are not verified have higher number of charge-offs when compared with verified, followed by verified from source. But the difference in not verified and verified count is not very significant.
Loans taken for Debt consolidation purpose had the highest number of charge offs. The lending company should be cautious when approving loans for debt consolidation purpose.
 California had the highest number of charge-offs. The lending company can implement stricter credit policies in California.

Ordered Categorical
Short term loans (term of 36 months) had higher charge-offs. The lending company should evaluate the loans carefully for shorter terms.
Loans with B grade had highest number of charge-offs indicating these customers faced difficulty in repaying the loans.
Loans with 10 + years of experience had higher number of charge-offs. Although, the total number of employees with 10+ years of experience is significantly higher than in other categories.
Loans issued in 2011 had the highest number of charge-offs. One potential reason could be economic difficulties in the specific year.
 Loans issued in fourth quarter had the highest number of charge-offs. One potential reason for this can be that loan underwriters are providing loans with less due diligence to complete their targets.
